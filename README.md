ypkg-tools
-----------

Simple tools to help developers to use ypkg more efficiently.
This project aims to replace the existing crusty `yauto.py`, `ybump.py`, and
`yupdate.py` collection of scripts currently seen in Solus.

**Note**:

This is also my first Go project so it'll help me to learn the language
a bit better :p
